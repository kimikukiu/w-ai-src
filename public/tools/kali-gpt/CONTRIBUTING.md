## 📝 Coding Standards

### Python Style
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and modular

### Security Considerations
- **CRITICAL**: All new features must include safety controls
- Never remove or weaken existing security checks
- Add confirmation prompts for dangerous operations
- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize commands before execution
- Document security implications

### Documentation
- Update README.md for new features
- Add examples for new functionality
- Update QUICK_START.md if adding menu options
- Comment complex code sections

## 🔒 Security Guidelines

### Responsible Development
- Only add features for **authorized** security testing
- Include safety warnings for dangerous operations
- Never encourage illegal activities
- Add proper error handling
- Validate and sanitize all inputs

### Testing Security Features
- Test with safe, isolated environments
- Never test on production systems
- Use local VMs or authorized lab environments
- Document testing procedures

- [ ] Team collaboration features
- [ ] Database integration for findings
- [ ] Attack tree visualization
- [ ] Custom tool profiles

## 🔧 Adding New Tools (v3.0)

To add support for a new penetration testing tool:

1. **Add to VALID_TOOLS** in `kali-gpt-autonomous.py`:
   ```python
   VALID_TOOLS = {
       'nmap', 'nikto',
       'your-new-tool',  # Add here
       ...
   }
   ```

2. **Add timeout** if needed in `get_timeout()`:
   ```python
   def get_timeout(tool):
       if tool in ['nmap', 'masscan']:
           return 300
       elif tool == 'your-new-tool':
           return 120  # Add custom timeout
       ...
   ```

3. **Add fallback command** (optional):
   ```python
   self.fallbacks = [
       f"nmap -sV {target}",
       f"your-new-tool --option {target}",  # Add here
       ...
   ]
   ```

## 🐬 Adding Model Support (v3.0)

To add a new uncensored model:

1. **Add to UNCENSORED_MODELS** list:
   ```python
   UNCENSORED_MODELS = [
       'kali-pentester',
       'dolphin-llama3',
       'your-new-model',  # Add here
       ...
   ]
   ```

2. **Create a Modelfile** (optional):
   ```dockerfile
   # Modelfile.your-model
   FROM base-model
   PARAMETER temperature 0.7
   SYSTEM """Your custom system prompt for pentesting..."""
   ```

3. **Update install-models.sh** if needed

## 🧪 Testing

Before submitting a PR:

1. **Test autonomous mode**
   ```bash
   python3 kali-gpt-autonomous.py
   # Test with different models
   # Test on safe targets like scanme.nmap.org
   ```

2. **Test model selection**
   ```bash
   # Option 6 should show all models
   # Switching should work
   ```

3. **Test command validation**
   ```python
   # These should be accepted
   assert is_valid_command("nmap -sV target") == True
   
   # These should be rejected
   assert is_valid_command("Scan the target") == False
   ```

4. **Syntax check**
   ```bash
   python3 -m py_compile kali-gpt-autonomous.py
   ```

5. **Test with both model types**
   - Test with uncensored model (dolphin-llama3)
   - Test with standard model (llama3.2)
   - Verify fallback system works when LLM gives bad output
